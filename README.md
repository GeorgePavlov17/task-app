# **Task-App**

# **About the project**

Simple Task application build on Angular in which you can add and delete tasks for the day, also make some of them special by set a reminder on a current task. 

# **App backend**

In this app for the server i am using JSON Server (full fake REST API) - it is giving me a local server to work with - it can't be deployed - not for LIVE, it's only for local use. 
How it works - create a simple db.json file with different collections inside and then I run a script (npm i json-server) who run json server watching that file and make over it GET, PUT, POST, DELETE requests, with them I am deleting data, adding data and so on. 
With the command - npm run server - we run the server on the port that we set into the scripts in package.json file. 

# **Tools used for building of the project:**
